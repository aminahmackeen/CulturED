Our goal with this project is to help secondary teachers implement culturally sustaining practices into the classroom to create an inclusive educational environment where students of all backgrounds feel represented in the classroom. According to the Institute of Education Sciences, culturally sustaining pedagogies share four common things:
They center dynamic communities and their languages, practices, and knowledge.
They include student and intergenerational community agency and input, recognizing that families/caregivers and community members are experts in their own right.
They support positive relationships with the land and the people of the land.
They provide structured opportunities to contend with internalized oppressions.
Through these, students are able to learn about their own histories, build critical awareness of systems/structures, and are taught resilience and joy within their communities. When curriculum reflects student experiences, students gain a sense of pride and belonging. We believe that when students learn about their own histories and cultural identities in the world, they should be taught with respect, cultural sensitivity, and not purely from a western and white-centric perspective. Our hope is to help young adults build identity, have a deeper connection with their peers and their community, are able to engage with class material on a personal level, and understand how their histories are interconnected with others.


To further work on this project, future coders can clone our repository, and flesh out the interactability of our site by adding comments and the ability to share photos / videos / audios to the story. They can work on adding moderation to stories posted to our site. Also, you can work on the display of stories on the timeline to make it more visually appealing and have a representative picture or something on the cover, not just the words.
